Readme
----------------------------------------------------
Project to train neural networks as game playing AI.
The underlying code is a NEAT library belonging to the University of Austin, Texas.
There are files included to simulate the running of the Snake game. The code used to train the neural network is located in
snake_experiment.cpp . 


NEAT source code distribution version 1.2, 7/23/10
----------------------------------------------------

The NEAT software is based on the real-time NeuroEvolution of
Augmenting Topologies method of evolving artificial neural networks, by
Stanley and Miikkulainen (2002).

Source code included in this release is originally written by Kenneth
Stanley (kstanley@cs.ucf.edu).  The official distribution site is:

http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?neat-c

The core NEAT code is updated significantly from earlier releases.  Traits
can now be made functional,  and adaptive networks can be evolved (though
the default is  non-adaptive).
